# CPL1.0
Auxiliary codes for fault prediction and prognosis of Tennessee Eastman process using a hybrid model 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do a trial of CPL1.0, please installl HMM toolbox by Kevin Murphy. Follow the instructions given in https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm_usage.html.
Once the HMM tool box is active, load the datafile named 'CPL1.0_Complete_System_for fault prediction and prognosis'.
This contains the training data files, testing data files, and all the parameters trained to predict the fault A in Tennessee Estman process.
Please refer to (Don and Khan, 2019) and (Galagedarage Don aand Khan, 2019).

Note: If you run the program, from the begining, it will generate a different prediction.
The best answer can be determined by performing 10 or more simulations and considering the mode of the results.
